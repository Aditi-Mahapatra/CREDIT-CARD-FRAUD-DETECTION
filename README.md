# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Description

This project involves building and evaluating machine learning models for detecting credit card fraud. The dataset used in this project contains credit card transactions, and the goal is to classify transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The project includes the following machine learning models:

- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **CatBoost Classifier**

Each model's performance is evaluated using various metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Matthews correlation coefficient, and confusion matrix.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `catboost`
- `xgboost`
- `lightgbm`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn catboost xgboost lightgbm
